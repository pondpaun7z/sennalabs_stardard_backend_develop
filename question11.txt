My proud project is CMUTimetable (http://cmutimetable.sevenz.info). This website used for student Chiang Mai University eaziest to view a class timetable and examination table and I started learning Ruby on Rails on this project sine 2016. I start on design until deploy to AWS EC2. I do by myself. This project succeeded since 2016 to 2018 because have students used my website up to 5,000 people but my website closed because my website access public url on Chiang Mai University website and now Chiang Mai University website renew website. It's impact to my website
